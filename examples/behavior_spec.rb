# The Behavior Spec: ruby/spec exists because "MRI does X" is not a
# specification - it's an implementation detail wearing one. When
# TruffleRuby and JRuby needed to know what Ruby MEANS, the answer
# had to be executable, implementation-neutral, and phrased as
# behavior. Same medicine here: a compliance file for the framework's
# subtlest semantics, in a 30-line mspec so the spec depends on
# nothing it's specifying.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/behavior_spec.rb
#
# Runs offline; exits 1 if any pinned behavior drifts.
