# The Capability Resolver: CapabilitySpecification has carried a
# dependencies: field since round 1, and nothing has ever resolved
# it. Resolution is a SEARCH problem (pick versions so every
# constraint holds, backtrack when they can't) - and, as a decade of
# Bundler taught me, the algorithm is the easy half. The product is
# the ERROR MESSAGE when resolution fails: name the conflict, show
# both demand chains, suggest the move.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/capability_resolver.rb

# Runs offline; one resolve succeeds, one fails USEFULLY.
