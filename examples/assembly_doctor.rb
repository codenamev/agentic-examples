# The Assembly Doctor: syntax_suggest for plans. When a 12-step plan
# won't assemble, "KeyError: task not found" is technically true the
# way "syntax error, unexpected end" is technically true - it names
# the symptom and hides the street address. The doctor examines a
# broken plan spec the way syntax_suggest examines a broken file:
# find the smallest region that explains the failure, SHOW it with
# an arrow pointing at the problem, and suggest the one-keystroke
# fix when the framework can see it. Error messages are the UI of
# failure, and failure is most of programming.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/assembly_doctor.rb

# Runs offline; diagnoses two classic assembly wounds, then proves
# the repaired plan actually runs.
