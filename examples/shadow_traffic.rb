# Shadow Traffic: the safest way to replace a component at scale is
# to never let the replacement answer. The OLD implementation serves
# every request; the NEW one runs beside it in the shadow - same
# inputs, measured and compared, its results thrown away. Users feel
# nothing; you collect a mismatch report and a latency comparison,
# and the cutover decision becomes a table instead of a leap.
