# frozen_string_literal: true

# The Freight Desk: a quoting capability whose tariff book is written
# as cross-field contract rules (new this round). Per-key checks catch
# nonsense; rules: catch the LEGAL-LOOKING orders that violate policy -
# and every broken rule is reported at once, because a shipper fixing
# their manifest deserves the whole list, not a scavenger hunt.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/freight_rules.rb
