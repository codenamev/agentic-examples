# Honest Doubles: every fake LLM in every agent test suite is lying a
# little - the question is whether anyone checks. The discipline:
# (1) don't mock what you don't own - wrap the vendor in an adapter
# whose interface YOU define; (2) verify every double against that
# interface (methods AND arity), so a rename breaks the test suite
# loudly instead of letting a thousand fakes drift into fiction.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/honest_doubles.rb

# Runs offline; one double is honest, one drifted. Guess which passes.
