# The Plan Server: a server is three disciplines wearing one process -
# accept concurrently, share resources safely, and above all SHUT DOWN
# WELL. This serves plan executions over a real socket with a thread
# pool, a shared (mutexed) rate limit across all request threads, and
# the part everyone skips: a graceful drain where in-flight requests
# finish, new ones are refused, and the process exits clean.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/plan_server.rb

# Runs offline; the socket is loopback, the clients are threads.
