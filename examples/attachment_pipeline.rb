# The Attachment Pipeline: Shrine's central lesson is that file
# uploads are a TWO-PHASE commit wearing a file input - phase one
# (cache) must be instant and disposable, phase two (promote +
# derivatives) is slow, background, and idempotent, because users
# double-submit, workers die mid-thumbnail, and retries must never
# double-bill. A plan with a journal is exactly the right machine
# for phase two.
