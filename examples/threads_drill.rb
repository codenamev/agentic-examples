# The Threads Drill: fibers are polite; threads are not. Everything
# in this gem that claims to be shared-safe gets hammered by real
# Ruby threads - the kind that run truly parallel on JRuby, where
# there is no GVL to be your accidental bodyguard. The journal and
# registry hold. The windowed limiter's bookkeeping is the one to
# watch, and the drill says so out loud.
