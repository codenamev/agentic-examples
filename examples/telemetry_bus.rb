# The Telemetry Bus: lifecycle hooks are callbacks - one producer,
# one consumer, coupled at configuration time. A telemetry bus
# inverts that: the orchestrator emits NAMED EVENTS into a bus, and
# any number of handlers attach, detach, and crash independently.
# The producer never learns who is listening. This is the :telemetry
# pattern Elixir converged on, because every library inventing its
# own instrumentation callbacks was the worse world.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/telemetry_bus.rb
#
# Runs offline; three handlers listen, one detaches mid-flight.
