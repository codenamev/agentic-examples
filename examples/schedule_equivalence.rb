# Schedule Equivalence: a plan's declared meaning is its dependency
# graph - which implies a PROMISE nobody usually tests: outputs must
# not depend on the schedule. Run the same plan at concurrency 1, 2,
# and 8; if the outputs differ, the plan has an undeclared dependency
# smuggled through shared state. This prover runs both an honest plan
# and a smuggler, and shows the exact fix.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/schedule_equivalence.rb

# Runs offline; exits 1 only if the HONEST plan proves schedule-dependent.
