# The Railway Plan: dry-monads taught Ruby that failure handling is
# COMPOSITION, not rescue blocks - a pipeline of steps where success
# rides the happy track and the first failure switches every later
# step onto the bypass, carrying WHY. TaskResult/TaskFailure are
# already Result values in street clothes; this gives them bind, so
# a plan's outcome composes like a railway instead of nesting like
# an if-tree.
