# The Stdlib Census: "it's in the standard library" is a statement
# with a shelf life. Default gems become bundled gems on a published
# schedule, and every `require` your gem makes is either covered by
# ruby itself, covered by your gemspec, or a warning that hasn't
# fired yet. This census reads lib/'s requires, cross-checks the
# gemspec, and flags everything the next Ruby will bill you for.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/stdlib_census.rb
#
# Runs offline; exits 1 if any require is covered by nobody.
