# The Supervision Tree: "let it crash" for plans. The agents in this
# file contain NO rescue clauses - error handling is not the worker's
# job. Recovery is a POLICY, and policies live one level up, in a
# supervisor that knows three strategies from OTP: one_for_one
# (restart the crashed child, keep everyone else's work),
# rest_for_one (restart the crashed child and every child started
# after it - their state may derive from its world), one_for_all
# (restart everything). And because a supervisor that restarts
# forever is just a slow crash, restart INTENSITY is bounded: exceed
# it and the failure escalates up the tree, loudly.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/supervision_tree.rb
#
# Runs offline; the same crash is supervised three ways, then a
# hopeless child exhausts its restart budget.
