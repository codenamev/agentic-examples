# Plans as Automata: strip away the agents and the LLMs and a plan is
# a transition system - states are sets of completed tasks, and each
# step completes one task whose dependencies are satisfied. Which
# means questions about plans ("can it finish?", "must it finish?",
# "what can run together?") aren't matters of testing or opinion:
# they're REACHABILITY, and small plans let us compute the entire
# state space and simply look.

#   bundle exec ruby examples/plans_as_automata.rb

# Runs offline; the whole state machine is enumerated, then judged.
