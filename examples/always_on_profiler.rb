# The Always-On Profiler: the mini-profiler heresy is that profiling
# belongs in PRODUCTION, on EVERY request, visible to the people who
# wrote the slow code - not in a lab you visit twice a year. Every
# plan gets a badge line; plans over their latency budget get named,
# with the top offender attached; and the profiler measures its own
# overhead, because always-on is only defensible when it's near-free.
