# The Batch Import: 500 rows of the kind of data people actually
# upload - typos, header drift, impossible combinations - run through
# one contract. Good rows proceed; bad rows land in a REJECT FILE
# with the field, the reason, and the rule that caught them. An
# importer that raises on row 37 is a tool for importing 36 rows.
