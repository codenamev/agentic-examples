# The Escalation Ladder: the pattern under every AI product that
# survives contact with customers. The machine does the whole job it
# can PROVE it can do, and hands the rest up a ladder - tier 0
# auto-resolves from playbooks, tier 1 drafts for known-but-nuanced
# intents, and the human queue takes the rest. Two rules make it a
# product instead of a demo: confidence thresholds are BUSINESS
# POLICY as data (not vibes in a prompt), and sensitivity TRUMPS
# confidence - the machine can be 95% sure about a legal threat and
# 100% wrong to touch it. Escalation hands over a dossier, never a
# shrug.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/support_escalation.rb
#
# Runs offline; six tickets ride the ladder, exit 1 if any lands
# on the wrong rung.
