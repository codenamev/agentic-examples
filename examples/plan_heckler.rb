# The Plan Heckler: mutation testing for workflows. Your plan has
# tests. Cute. Do the tests actually FAIL when the plan is wrong, or
# are they decoration? The heckler finds out the honest way: it
# breaks the plan on purpose - five sabotages, one at a time - and
# runs your spec against each mutant. A mutant your spec kills is
# coverage. A mutant that SURVIVES is a bug your tests would wave
# through the door. Tests that can't fail aren't tests.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/plan_heckler.rb
#
# Runs offline; exits 1 if any mutant survives the final spec.
