# The Concurrency Key: "at most one sync per TENANT, any number of

# system eventually needs - global limits are too blunt (one tenant's
# backlog throttles everyone) and no limits are too sharp (two syncs
# for the same tenant race each other's writes). SolidQueue spells it
# concurrency_key; here it's one Mutex-guarded registry of per-key
# RateLimits, and the overflow policy is EXPLICIT: block, or skip.
