# The Polite Form: a contract usually speaks AFTER you fail - a 422,
# a stack of violations. This assistant makes it speak FIRST, turning
# every declaration into a question: required keys become requests,
# bounds become gentle corrections, and relation rules become the
# follow-ups a good clerk asks ("express? then I'll need a customs
# code"). Zero errors are ever shown; the contract is the script.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/polite_form.rb

# Runs offline; the "user" answers from a queue.
