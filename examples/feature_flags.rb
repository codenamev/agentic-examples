# Feature Flags for Plans: shipping a new pipeline step shouldn't be
# a deploy decision - it should be a FLAG decision. A tiny Flipper-
# shaped adapter (boolean, actor, percentage gates) decides per run
# whether the experimental step joins the plan, and rewire_task
# splices it in or routes around it. Same code in production for
# everyone; different plans per actor.
