# The Retry Budget: a retry storm is a self-inflicted DDoS - every
# job politely retrying 3x turns one outage into four. Retries are a
# SHARED resource, so give the fleet one wallet: transient failures
# spend from it, hopeless failures spend nothing (they get no retry
# at all), and when the wallet is empty the kindest thing left is
# failing fast - the fleet already knows the upstream is down.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/retry_budget.rb

# Runs offline; the upstream is dead for the whole run.
