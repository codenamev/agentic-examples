# The Job Adapter: your Rails app already has a vocabulary for
# background work - perform_later, retry_on, discard_on - and the
# fastest way to adopt a new tool is to let it speak that vocabulary.
# This wraps a plan in an ActiveJob-shaped class: retry_on maps to
# the framework's retry policy, discard_on maps to the hopeless
# convention, and your team learns nothing new until they want to.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/job_adapter.rb

# Runs offline; the queue is an array, the lessons are real.
