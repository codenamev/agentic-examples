# The Plan Lockfile: Gemfile.lock for workflows. A plan that says
# "give me text.summarize ~> 1.0" is a WISH; production runs need a
# FACT. `lock` resolves constraints once and writes plan.lock -
# exact versions plus a content digest per capability. `run --frozen`
# resolves nothing: it verifies the world still matches the lockfile
# and refuses to run anything it didn't agree to - a new version
# published? ignored until you relock. an implementation edited
# in place under the same version number? REFUSED BY DIGEST,
# because "same version, different code" is the lie lockfiles exist
# to catch.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/plan_lockfile.rb
#
# Runs offline; exits 1 unless frozen runs are deterministic and
# drift is refused with a usable message.
