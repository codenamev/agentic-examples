# The Failure Weather Report: a journal of three days, read as a
# forecast. Retryable failures are WEATHER - showers that pass on
# their own or with an umbrella. Non-retryable failures are CLIMATE -
# no amount of waiting fixes a drought; someone must dig a well.
# The journal now records which is which at the moment it rains.

# Runs offline; three scripted days of mixed conditions.
