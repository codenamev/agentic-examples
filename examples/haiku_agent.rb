# The three-line agent. Run me with no API key at all:
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/haiku_agent.rb
#
# An agent, a capability, a result - each expressed the way Ruby wants
# to express it: a block, a lambda, a hash. Nothing here talks to a
# network; capabilities are just callables, so the whole plan-and-execute
# idea is graspable in one screen.
