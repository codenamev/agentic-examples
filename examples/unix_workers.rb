# Unix Workers: I like Unix because the operating system already
# solved process supervision and nobody told the frameworks. A
# master preforks N plan workers, work arrives on a pipe, SIGTERM
# means "finish what you hold, then die with dignity", and the
# master reaps every child by PID and exit status. No supervisor
# gem, no thread pool config - fork(2), pipe(2), kill(2), wait(2).
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/unix_workers.rb
#
# Runs offline; every process is real, every signal is real.
