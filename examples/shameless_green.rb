# Shameless Green: the 99 Bottles discipline applied to a plan. Step
# zero is one god task that does everything - and it's GREEN, and we
# are not ashamed, because green output pinned as a golden master is
# what buys every move after it. Then the refactoring loop: extract
# ONE responsibility per step, re-run the whole plan, and compare
# output byte-for-byte. A step that "improves the design" while
# changing the answer is not a refactoring - it's a bug with good
# posture, and the referee rejects it. Design metrics (tasks, max
# responsibilities per task, graph depth) are computed, not asserted.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/shameless_green.rb
#
# Runs offline; one extraction is deliberately botched to prove the
# rope holds. Exit 1 unless the final shape is single-responsibility
# AND the output never changed.
