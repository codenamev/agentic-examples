# The Queue-Time Autoscaler: the Speedshop rule, closed-loop. Most
# autoscalers trigger on utilization, which is a lie with a
# dashboard - a healthy busy server and a drowning one can post the
# same number. The metric with a user attached is QUEUE TIME: how
# long work sat waiting for a worker. This scaler measures it at the
# only honest place (around the acquire), scales by Little's law
# (workers = arrival rate x service time, plus headroom), resizes
# the live pool, and lets the next wave prove the math.
