# The Write Path Profile: everyone's first instinct about a slow
# journal is "switch JSON libraries". Before holding that opinion,
# weigh each layer of the write separately - serialize, write, flush,
# fsync - because optimization budgets get spent where the profiler
# points or they get wasted. Spoiler: the disk's honesty is the
# product, and it is also the bill.
