# frozen_string_literal: true

# Contract Fixtures: example payloads in docs rot the day the contract
# changes. So don't write them - DERIVE them. This generator reads a
# capability's declarations and produces a minimal fixture (required
# keys only) and a maximal one (everything), then a referee proves
# every generated fixture passes its own contract, and that a mutated
# fixture still fails. Docs that compile, effectively.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/contract_fixtures.rb
#
# Runs offline; exits 1 if the generator and validator disagree.
