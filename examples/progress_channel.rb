# The Progress Channel: broadcasting plan progress to N subscribers
# is easy until one subscriber is slow - then your "real-time" layer
# quietly becomes a memory leak or a brake on the plan itself.
# AnyCable years distilled to one rule: every channel names its
# BACKPRESSURE POLICY. This one offers two - :latest_wins for
# dashboards (drop stale frames), :every_event for auditors (bounded
# buffer, disconnect on overflow) - and proves each under a slow
# subscriber.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/progress_channel.rb
#
# Runs offline; the slow subscriber is deliberately awful.
