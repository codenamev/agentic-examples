# shipped this round as fsync_every:). Here are the three riffs that
# could have been, each runnable, each judged at its call site.

puts "      on the object."
puts "    - a whole constant surface for one integer today - the wardrobe"
puts "      is bigger than the costume. YAGNI has a case here."

# --- riff 3: the per-call escape hatch --------------------------------------------

puts "    - and that's the indictment: durability becomes a per-CALL-SITE"
puts "      opinion. the invariant 'this journal survives crashes' stops"
puts "      being a property of the OBJECT and starts being a property of"
puts "      every author's judgment forever. flexibility is where"
puts "      invariants go to die."
puts

puts "  the riff verdict: shape 1 shipped, and the reading explains why -"
puts "  a durability contract belongs to the OBJECT (riff 3 dissolves"
puts "  it), and one integer doesn't yet earn a policy wardrobe (riff 2"
puts "  can arrive later, wrapping the kwarg, if flush-after-100ms ever"
puts "  becomes real). but note what the exercise cost: forty lines and"
puts "  ten minutes, versus the years a shipped API lives. riff BEFORE"
puts "  you commit - call sites read differently than class definitions,"
puts "  and the call site is where your users actually live."
