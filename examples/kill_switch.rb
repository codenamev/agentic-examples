# The Kill Switch: feature flags answer "who should get this?";
# kill switches answer a grimmer question - "how fast can a human
# make this STOP?" Every capability that talks to money, email, or
# an external API needs a big red button: instant, global, requiring
# no deploy, leaving an audit trail of who pressed it and why. Two
# minutes of incident is a story; twenty is a postmortem.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/kill_switch.rb
#
# Runs offline; an incident is simulated, the button is pressed.
