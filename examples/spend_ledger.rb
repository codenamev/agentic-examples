# The Spend Ledger: LLM plans spend real money, and money has rules
# older than software - integer cents (floats round YOUR money, never
# theirs), a ledger where every entry has a description, and a budget
# that stops the spending BEFORE the overdraft, not in the postmortem.
# The journal already receipts every task; this makes the receipts
# denominate.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/spend_ledger.rb
#
# Runs offline; the invoice at the end balances to the cent.
