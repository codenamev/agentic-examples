# The Relation Diff: round 8's semver advisor classified declaration
# changes but had to shrug at rules - lambdas can't be compared. Now
# relations are data, so the RULES diff too: a tightened limit is
# breaking, a loosened one compatible, a new rule breaking, a removed
# one compatible, and a changed relation TYPE is a different law
# entirely. The last opaque corner of the contract joins semver.
#
#   bundle exec ruby examples/relation_diff.rb

# Runs offline; v2 contains one of every interesting rule change.
