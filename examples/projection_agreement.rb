# The Projection Agreement Prover: relation rules now render twice -
# the validator enforces them in Ruby, and to_json_schema projects
# them into draft-07 keywords (dependencies, not-required). Two
# renderings of one law can drift, so this prover evaluates BOTH
# against every presence combination and demands they agree. It also
# walks to the exact frontier where they don't: JSON's null.

# --- the frontier: explicit nulls ---------------------------------------------

# metaphysics of absence - walk to the exact spot where they part.
#
# First discovery: for TYPED fields the frontier is guarded. An
# explicit nil never reaches the relation check, because per-key
# typing rejects it first ("must be boolean"), and the schema rejects
# it too (dependencies fire) - agreement, but for different reasons.

# over any UNTYPED field stays out of the draft-07 keywords entirely

# a law it can't render faithfully.
