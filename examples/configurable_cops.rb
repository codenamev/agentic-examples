# Configurable Cops: a style guide nobody can configure is a style
# FIGHT on a delay timer. RuboCop's deepest lesson isn't any single
# cop - it's the .yml: enable/disable per cop, parameters instead of
# hardcoded taste, and (the policy that saved a thousand upgrades)
# NEW COPS ARRIVE PENDING - they never fire until the team opts in,
# so a linter update can't turn a green build red by surprise.
