# The Plan Kata: red, green, refactor - for a plan. The "tests" are
# assertions about the graph (one root, one leaf, labeled joins,
# nothing too deep), written BEFORE any tasks exist. Each step adds
# the smallest thing that moves a red line green, and the refactor
# step changes structure with the assertions standing guard. You've
# TDD'd methods; plans deserve the same discipline.
