# The Cancel Drill: structured concurrency's core promise is that
# cancellation is PROMPT - stop means stop, not "finish everything
# and then agree you'd stopped". Three drills measure what each
# cancel path actually delivers. In round 10 this drill caught
# plan-wide cancel billing for every canceled task; the round-11
# release fixed it, and this file is the acceptance test that keeps
# it fixed.
