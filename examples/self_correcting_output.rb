# Self-Correcting Output: the pattern that makes LLM components
# shippable. The model's output is validated against the capability's
# contract; violations don't raise to the user - they become the
# CORRECTION PROMPT for a bounded retry. The contract is the editor,
# the model is the writer, and the loop converges or fails honestly
# with the full paper trail.
